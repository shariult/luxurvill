# Luxurvill - Template

Frontend template developed as Portfolio project build with [project with parcel](https://github.com/shariult/projects-with-parcel.git). But it should work with any Parcel configured package. Final build can be found in the "dist" directory once project is deployed. Visit [Luxurvill](https://shariul.com/assets/projects/luxurvill/) for live view.

## Tools Required
